       "      <td>dont reinitiate youre clearly super bitter and that will turn into resentment dont pretend to be ok with a friendship that you dont actually want just to be near her   anger in response to rejection is a sign that you have personal issues to deal with like what are you angry at who are you angry at bummed makes sense but anger is an antisocial and maladaptive response to rejection   stay away from her and figure out why someone wanting something else for themselves inspires anger in you its like youre taking it as a personal affront sounds like you think the rejection makes you less worthy or like you think someone owes you reciprocated feelings and thats not good math good luck</td>\n",

       "162243  ive been doing a lot of self reflecting lately and although i was aware of this to an extent before im really seeing how much stress and chaos surrounds my day to day life nothing comes easy to me everything always goes wrong for me these are the things ive told myself but when i really think about it i see that the common denominator in all these stressful situations bad bosses relationship issues friendship problems etc is me i am almost always in a crisis mode and its exhausting and i tend to blame everyone else for my problems very woe is me but i can see pretty clearly that im the cause of most of them its one thing after another  with all this being said what im facing is that im incredibly embarrassed and sad to be seen as the friendperson who is chaotic and draining to be around i want to be a good friend and not be a bummer i try very hard to show my friends im there for them all the time and ive definitely improved on a lot of my selfish behaviours as in the past i just dont think i realized how chaotic i was and how i made everything about me and how i was the one bringing the drama but even with these improvements and being more self aware i just know that my close friends are tired of me already and i cant change how ive acted previously  i want to learn to be better im going to start therapy consistently this month now that i can afford it and im hoping that helps but does anyone else have any tips i just dont want to be that person and it makes me sad to know i have been do i just need to make new friends and change who i am for them so im not like this im struggling as i dont think its healthy to bottle everything up all the time friends do talk to each other about big life things after all but i no longer want to be seen as a drag so it seems easier to say nothing  has anyone here been this friend before or been a friend to someone in constant crisis what did you dohow did you handle it i just want to be better for myself and for my loved ones  \n",

       "      <td>the difference youre referring to is the one between imagining a better future and living in the moment and enjoying that the former can be very pleasurable but its not real and it wont get you anywhere but of course that doesnt keep many people from having day dreams like that their whole life without ever acting on them what you need to do if you actually want to make any of those dreams a reality is to become grounded in the present moment and to focus on doing rather than thinking so if you want to make a change in your life then figure out what exactly it is what you want to achieve then think about how you can get there and what you can start doing right now and then do that thats all there is to it the difference between those that change their lives and those who only dream about it is that the former focus on taking action while the latter only keeps thinking about it making plans and trying to figure everything out without ever lifting a finger to actually do any work that might make you feel like youve done a lot of work but have you really achieved anything at all just by thinking and planning  focus on doing start taking small steps but start doing it right away dont put things off just do it that is what will cause lasting change its not about the end result its about who you become in the process and if you never get started in the first place then nothing can ever change for you or at least whatever changes you will encounter will rarely be what youve hoped for so focus on doing and that will also lead you to live more in the moment instead of in the past and future which arent real anyway they only exist in your head the only time that is real is the now so if you want to make some big changes in your life even if they might take months or years to accomplish you can only work on them right now in this moment and the sooner you start the sooner youll see progress</td>\n",

       "131289  the future can only come in the now thats what you need to understand the past only exists in your memories memories of events that happened at some point in the now while any thoughts about the future are just that ideas for what might happen at some point in the now when the time comes but theyre just thoughts and worries about what might happen and usually theyre unfounded sure you could die in some accident at some point but is there any actual indiciation that this could really happen anythings possible and if you keep dwelling on the future you will be able to come up with an endless amount of things to live in fear of but most of them will never come to pass so youre better off focusing on the here and now instead  you need to see the distinction between making plans and preparing for the future and just worrying about all kind of things that could possibly happen but probably wont if you have an appointment set for tomorrow then you should prepare for it and you can only do that in the now then when youre prepared you will go to that appointment and respond properly to anything that happens there and you will again do so in the now  but you cant prepare properly if you keep dwelling on all the stuff that could come up like i said our mind is very creative when it comes to such things so you can spend the rest of your life coming up with scenarios that will never come to pass and this will keep you from living in the now it will keep you from preparing properly for anything that might actually happen and it will turn you into a wreck if you keep worrying about pointless things like that all the time  or what could also happen is that you create a future in your head that seems much more enjoyable than your current circumstances and so now youll probably want to spend more time dwelling on it imagining that future than youd want to spend in the here and now which is the only place where you can work on creating that future so if all you do is fantasize then that will be all youll have because youll never do what you have to do make your wishes a reality so stop wasting time thinking about the future have a plan so that you know where youre going and prepare ahead for things that you should be prepared for but otherwise focus on the here and now as thats where life takes place everything that ever happens to you happens in the now not in the future and whatever happened in the past is already in the past so no point dwelling on it either  \n",

       "144096  then why dont you change things what else is there to do mope about it suicide sure isnt gonna change anything youll just take the easy way out no more hassle more struggle if youre seeing yourself as a loser now then youll still be that only a dead loser  so if that doesnt make you happy then why not change it just take action dont know how figure it out that is the first step what else is there to do alternatively sit down for a few hours or however long you need and think long and hard about what you could do right now that would actually make any difference in your life complaining about your cruel fate nope suicide nope wallowing in self pity or asking others to pity you nope none of those things would make any difference only your action with the aim of causing a change can do so so figure out what youd like to have in your life what would you like to improve what would it take to achieve that dont think of the some big ambitious goal you can as its more motivating then when it comes to taking action only focus on the step that you can and should take right now what would that be figure that out then take that step and then figure out then next one and keep going  stop comparing yourself to others because its also nothing but a waste of time focus on doing what you want its your life and other people dont matter let them live their lifes as they see fit you focus on yours because thats the only one that really matters to you the only one that you can have full control over and you should  \n",

       "      <td>go to another dietician dont do any rash diets dont overdo exercise on day one but rather focus more on consistency for folks with a tendency to gain weight easily a lot of patience is needed because it takes a while for the weight to reduce to a good range  but more than that it takes long term lifestyle changes and good habits to ensure you hover in that range   get all the necessary nutrients eat salads with lunch eat proteins for dinner and after exercising have one fruit a day keep some light snacks and teas handy drinking insufficient water also leads to weight gain walking helps increase metabolism avoid fatty fried foods and junk food high sugar food home cooked food is the best for losing weight if the diet makes you unhappy and irritable its not going to work long term dont take any drugs or meds without a doctor okaying it   for mental motivation  ive heard of people get diabetes due to weight have the diabetes exacerbate till they were losing sight and even small long term changes like giving up soft drinks which apparently they drank a lot led to things reversing and they got their eyesight back then exercised and improved their health a lot even if youre in a bad phase right now you can for sure get out of it</td>\n",

       "489633  what you do matters not if youre doing something you can jog for hours each day but what will that do for you a good weight lifting routine can allow you to build lots of muscle working out only 3 times per week for an hour each if you do it right and of course diet also plays a big part in that if youre not eating enough youll have a hard time gaining any weight and if you eat lots of junk then your muscles might always remain covered up by thick layers of fat  while lifting weights is very convenient and makes progressing a lot easier there are ways to progress doing body weight exercises as well especially if you can do more complex exercises like the stuff typically found in calisthenics if youve seen any youtubers doing that stuff you should already know it works for building muscle and gymnasts also generally have a very well trained physique calisthenics seems to be largely based on their training  but it all depends on whats available to you if you dont have the kind of equipment thats necessary for a proper calisthenics workout then your options will be a lot more limited but there still are options as ive also discovered a while ago ive found a program that contains lots of variations of simple bodyweight exercises so that you can progress even without adding weights just by switching to more difficult variations once youve achieved the target reps for any exercise and getting to the point where you can do one armed pushups or pullups will require you to build a ton of strength so it is possible to increase your strength and keep progressing even with simple bodyweight exercises for some time  and in case it wasnt clear yet progression is the key if you keep doing the same thing every day youll stop progressing quickly thats the problem with doing bodyweight pushups for example unless youre gaining weight the only way to progress is to do more reps which probably wont really help you build muscle because for that you need to increase the strain as you would do by increasing the weight you lift but like i said you can do that with bodyweight exercises as well by switching to a more difficult variation just look for a proper bodyweight workout that provides a progression system like that  \n",

       "92768   this is fucking ridiculous but tiktok actually helped me a bit so many of the weird quirks i have i thought were just me but it turns out im not as weird as i thought   started to realise that other people were just as flawed and awkward and id been holding myself to way higher standards than i had for other people   if someone else tripped over their words while speaking i wouldnt think anything of it if i did it id be kicking myself in my head for the next 10 minutes   i also realised this obsession with what other people were thinking about me was bordering on narcissistic i dont dissect everything someone said to me so why would people be doing that to me im not that important   i mostly just started embracing my weirdness rather than hiding it if i say something stupid i laugh at myself and try not to take myself too seriously its the weirdness that makes your personality unique and the reason people will want to spend time with you   instead of constantly worrying about what im going to add to the conversation i really try and focus on the other person and be engaged in what theyre saying to me so i have a legitimate reactionare interested in asking more   and i realised that i dont have to try and make people like me or think im attractive or whatever if i have a conversation and come out of it feeling bad its probably because we just dont gel as people and thats ok theres people for everyone for example i dont get on well with people who do take things very seriously but i dont want to spend time with people like that so i dont care anymore  \n",
